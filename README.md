# WhatsTheTemp - Weather app

This app is made for AndroidDevChallenge with Jetpack Compose


 This app has 7 diffrent animations for 7 diffrent weather conditions
 
 Link to that animation screen records = https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sL22T-_nxXEK20ZNF1CIUF_StgbK34XL
 
 And I have also integrated my own idea in this app which is reading of weather summary to the user this is fired by TextToSpeech.This weather summary will include minimum temperature, maximum temperature, humidity, feels like, date, current temp
 
 
 
 **Used Logic less Fake weather data**
 
   To show you the 7 animations I have planned to generate random weather condition so there will be no relation between temperature and weather condition I mean no logic will be present in the fake data
