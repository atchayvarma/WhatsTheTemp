# WhatsTheTemp - Weather app

This app is made for AndroidDevChallenge with Jetpack Compose


 This app has 7 diffrent animations for 7 diffrent weather conditions
 
 Link to that animation screen records = https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sL22T-_nxXEK20ZNF1CIUF_StgbK34XL
 
 And I have also intergrated my own idea in this app which is reading of weather summary to the user this is fired by TextToSpeech.This weather summary will include minmum temperature, maximum temperature, humidity, feels like, date, cureent temp
 
 
 **Used Logic less Fake weather datas**
 
   To show you the 7 animations i have planned to genrate random weather condition so there will be no relation between temperature and weather condition i mean no logic will be prensent in the fake data
